Coefficient definitions for documentation purposes:

  LMD7_A0==(2^0x200-LMD7_D0)
  LMD7_A1==(2^0x200-LMD7_D1)

These numbers have been selected because they are easy to multiply by, and:

  LMD7_A0*2^0x200-1 is prime,
  LMD7_A1*2^0x200-1 is prime,
  LMD7_A0*2^0x1FF-1 is prime,
  and LMD7_A1*2^0x1FF-1 is prime.

which implies that the cycle lengths of the iterations (x,c)-->((LMD7_A0*x+c) MOD 2^0x400) and (x,c)-->((LMD7_A1*x+c) MOD 2^0x400) are the last 2 numbers above, respectively.

The exponents above are defined as follows:
