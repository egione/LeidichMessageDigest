Coefficient definitions for documentation purposes:

  LMD8_A0==(2^0x100-LMD8_D0)
  LMD8_A1==(2^0x100-LMD8_D1)

These numbers have been selected because they are easy to multiply by, and:

  LMD8_A0*2^0x100-1 is prime,
  LMD8_A1*2^0x100-1 is prime,
  LMD8_A0*2^0xFF-1 is prime,
  and LMD8_A1*2^0xFF-1 is prime.

which implies that the cycle lengths of the iterations (x,c)-->((LMD8_A0*x+c) MOD 2^0x200) and (x,c)-->((LMD8_A1*x+c) MOD 2^0x200) are the last 2 numbers above, respectively.

The exponents above are defined as follows:
